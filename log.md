# Change Log

## 2026-04-15 21:01:49 EDT

- Added the initial framework design note in `docs/simulation_framework_outline.md`.
- Documented the proposed package structure, abstract interfaces, evaluator design, and testing strategy for future simulation studies.
- Established `log.md` as the running record of meaningful updates in the repository.

- Scaffolded the `src/simlab` package hierarchy with `core`, `dgp`, `estimators`, `evaluation`, and `utils` modules.
- Added the first core dataclasses: `SampledData`, `EstimateResult`, and `TrialRecord`.
- Added abstract base classes for `DataGeneratingProcess`, `Estimator`, and `Evaluator`, using dictionaries for configs and defensive copying on initialization.
- Updated the framework note to reflect the adopted design choice of dataclasses for records and dictionaries for parameters.
- Kept the initial scaffold importable without requiring `numpy` at package import time.

## 2026-04-15 21:23:15 EDT

- Updated the framework note to make the base stack explicitly NumPy-first and to avoid pandas in the framework layer.
- Added `docs/implementation_status.md` as a quick reference for what is already implemented versus what is still planned.
